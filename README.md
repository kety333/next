# NextMovies

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.13.

You are the owner of a movie theater in Kfar Saba City. You want to excite your
customers and provide them an online service. This will give them more value and help
to keep them loyal.
- The online movies application will show the list of all the available movies.
- There should be an option to search - suggest search criterias and implement
  them (not provided in the XD below).
- When a movie is selected, show its details, including the image and data you can
  collect from the API.
- Add a back button to return to the movies list view.
